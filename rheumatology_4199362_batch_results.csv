She was diagnosedwith ulcerative colitis 3 years ago. The patient initially was treated with systemic steroids, and the disease is currently in remission on oralsulfasalazine.

The biopsy report shows no evidence of giant cell arteritis, only atherosclerosis.Which of the following is the best course of action?"

The oral mucosa is moist with mild tonsillar swelling, but there are no ulcers or other lesions. There is tenderness and swelling of the heel, as shown in the exhibit. Examination of the ankle and other joints shows no synovitis or effusion. Flexion and external rotation of the hip joints elicits intense pain at the gluteal region. Laboratory results are as follows: Complete blood count––Leukocytes 5,600/mm3, Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL, Platelets 320,000/mm3; C-reactive protein 10 mg/L (normal: <8).

For the last 3 months, the patient has had dull, achy pain in the lumbar area radiating to the buttocks bilaterally. The pain is worse with lifting heavy boxes and is not relieved with acetaminophen or heating pads. She has had no fever, weight change, dysuria, incontinence, abdominal pain, or muscular weakness. The patient's medical history is notable for hypertension, for which she takes chlorthalidone, and osteoarthritis of the knees and hands. She does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Blood pressure is 148/98 mm Hg and pulse is 84/min. BMI is 32 kg/m2. Examination shows normal range of motion in the lumbar spine. Lower extremity strength, sensation, and reflexes are normal. Straight leg raise causes worsening of pain in the back but no radiation of pain.

He takes over-the-counter decongestants. He is a construction worker, smokes a pack of cigarettes a day, and drinks 6 cans of beer once aweek. His mother suffers from severe rheumatoid arthritis.His temperature is 37.2 C (99 F), blood pressure is 122/70 mm Hg, and pulse is 89/min. He has tenderness on palpation of bilateral maxillarysinuses. Tympanic membranes are full and bulging bilaterally. Pulmonary auscultation reveals occasional rhonchi. There are no heart murmurs.The tip of the spleen is not palpable. There are no skin rashes or joint swelling.Laboratory results are as follows:Hemoglobin	9.5 g/dLLeukocytes	5,500/mm3Platelets	710,000/mmPotassium	4.5 mEq/LCreatinine	2.0 mg/dLLiver panel is unremarkable. Urinalysis is positive for blood and protein, and urine sediment analysis reveals multiple red blood cells casts. ChestX-ray is shown below.Which of the following is most likely to establish this patient's diagnosis?"

Laboratory results show normal blood counts, liver function tests, serum creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, TSH, serum parathyroid hormone, anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody assay, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and serum protein electrophoresis. 24-hour urine calcium excretion is 290 mg. DXA reveals a T-score of -2.8 in the hip and -3.6 in the spine, which represents a significant (>5%) decrease compared with her last test 2 years ago.

The pain is aggravated by any type of prolonged weight bearing. He feels particularly stiff in the hips in the mornings and after sitting in one place for a few hours. He was prescribed physical therapy and tramadol 4 months ago. After some temporary relief, he now feels more pain throughout the day, which limits his daily activities. He also received physical therapy last year, which provided only temporary relief. He denies any pain or swelling in his other joints or systemic symptoms. His daughter who accompanies him states that he had recently complained of dizziness.His other medical problems include type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, peripheral vascular disease, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. The patient lives at home by himself. His medications include aspirin, metformin, glipizide, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, acetaminophen, and tramadol.His vital signs are within normal limits. Range of motion of the spine is normal and without pain. There is no scoliosis or excessive kyphosis.
