The patient was diagnosed with extensive coronary artery disease a year ago and was offered coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. He refused surgery and instead opted for medical management. Since the medical therapy was started, the patient's symptoms have improved. He has angina during the daytime only after moderate to severe exertion. However, the patient still has been waking up 3-4 times per week in the middle of the night with substernal chest pain, which usually resolves spontaneously in 7-8 minutes but sometimes requires nitroglycerin. His other medical problems include difficult-to-control hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral vascular disease. The patient has smoked cigarettes for 35 years and quit 5 years ago. His medications include aspirin, metoprolol, isosorbide mononitrate, amlodipine, lisinopril, rosuvastatin, and nitroglycerin as needed. He takes all his medications during the morning hours.
 His blood pressure is 150/82 mm Hg, pulse is 62/min and regular, and respirations are 14/min. The patient is obese with large neck circumference and a BMI of 34 kg/m2. Chest is clear to auscultation. There is no peripheral edema. The remainder of the examination is normal.
 An electrocardiogram (ECG) performed in the office shows normal sinus rhythm with nonspecific T wave changes. His most recent echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%. During exercise single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) performed a month ago, the patient exercised for 8 minutes and reached 85% of age-predicted maximal predicted heart rate. He stopped due to fatigue and mild chest discomfort. Stress SPECT images showed a moderately extensive inferior wall reversible defect.

Pulse oximetry is 86% on room air. Lung examination reveals minimal bibasilar rales. Cardiac examination reveals regular rhythm with no significant audible murmurs or pericardial rub.
 An emergency cardiac catheterization shows an occluded proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). The left circumflex and right coronary arteries have mild luminal irregularities. An intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (IABP) device is inserted, and the patient undergoes successful primary angioplasty of the proximal LAD with drug-eluting stent placement.

The patient is started on low-dose metroprolol succinate and does well over the next 2 days.
 ECG show sinus rhythm with a persistent left bundle branch block pattern.
