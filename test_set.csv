Her medical history includes knee osteoarthritis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a myocardial infarction requiring bare-metal stent placement 14 months earlier. Her medications include acetaminophen, low-dose aspirin, and simvastatin. She had previously been prescribed a beta blocker but stopped taking it a couple months ago due to fatigue. At baseline, she is able to eat, dress, and use the bathroom without assistance. The patient is able to walk up only half a flight of stairs before stopping due to knee pain. She has no chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations. She is a lifetime nonsmoker. 
 
 The patient appears comfortable after intravenous morphine injection. Blood pressure is 154/80 mm Hg and pulse is 64/min. Oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. Physical examination shows an externally rotated and shortened left leg. No murmurs are heard on cardiac auscultation. Lungs are clear to auscultation. 
 
 Laboratory results are as follows: 
 
 Hemoglobin 11.5 g/dL 
 Creatinine 1.4 mg/dL 
 Glucose 110 mg/dL 
 
 ECG demonstrates normal sinus rhythm with Q waves in the inferior leads. X-ray of the left hip and pelvis demonstrates a displaced intertrochanteric fracture. Transthoracic echocardiogram obtained 6 months earlier reveals inferior wall hypokinesis, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50%, evidence of mild diastolic dysfunction, and no major valvular abnormalities
