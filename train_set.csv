The patient was diagnosed with extensive coronary artery disease a year ago and was offered coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. He refused surgery and instead opted for medical management. Since the medical therapy was started, the patient's symptoms have improved. He has angina during the daytime only after moderate to severe exertion. However, the patient still has been waking up 3-4 times per week in the middle of the night with substernal chest pain, which usually resolves spontaneously in 7-8 minutes but sometimes requires nitroglycerin. His other medical problems include difficult-to-control hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral vascular disease. The patient has smoked cigarettes for 35 years and quit 5 years ago. His medications include aspirin, metoprolol, isosorbide mononitrate, amlodipine, lisinopril, rosuvastatin, and nitroglycerin as needed. He takes all his medications during the morning hours.
 His blood pressure is 150/82 mm Hg, pulse is 62/min and regular, and respirations are 14/min. The patient is obese with large neck circumference and a BMI of 34 kg/m2. Chest is clear to auscultation. There is no peripheral edema. The remainder of the examination is normal.
 An electrocardiogram (ECG) performed in the office shows normal sinus rhythm with nonspecific T wave changes. His most recent echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%. During exercise single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) performed a month ago, the patient exercised for 8 minutes and reached 85% of age-predicted maximal predicted heart rate. He stopped due to fatigue and mild chest discomfort. Stress SPECT images showed a moderately extensive inferior wall reversible defect.

Pulse oximetry is 86% on room air. Lung examination reveals minimal bibasilar rales. Cardiac examination reveals regular rhythm with no significant audible murmurs or pericardial rub.
 An emergency cardiac catheterization shows an occluded proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). The left circumflex and right coronary arteries have mild luminal irregularities. An intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (IABP) device is inserted, and the patient undergoes successful primary angioplasty of the proximal LAD with drug-eluting stent placement.

The patient is started on low-dose metroprolol succinate and does well over the next 2 days.
 ECG show sinus rhythm with a persistent left bundle branch block pattern.

The left atrium was severely dilated and the mitre valve leaflets were thickened with restricted motion and mild focal calcification. The mitral valve area was calculated at 1.0 cm2 (normal 4-6 cm2) with a moderate degree of mitral regurgitation. The aortic valve was trileaflet without stenosis or regurgitation. There was moderate tricuspid regurgitation with an estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 72 mm Hg, consistent with severe pulmonary hypertension (normal <30 mm Hg).

 Her blood pressure is 128/76 mm Hg, pulse is 76/min, and respirations are 16/min. Jugular venous pressure is 10 cm H20. Examination shows clear lung fields with minimal rales at both lung bases. $3 is present, along with a faint I/VI holosystolic murmur over the cardiac apex. There is trace pitting edema at the ankles.
 
 Laboratory results are as follows:

 fever, chills, or constitutional symptoms. The patient works as a landscaper and has installed a lot of moss in terraced yards over the past month.
 He also hunts and within the past month has dressed rabbits that he has shot. He is in good health, takes no medications, and has no HIV risk
 factors.
 Vital signs are normal. Cardiopulmonary, abdominal, and neurologic examinations are normal. There are 3 tender papules on top of the dorsal
 aspects of the right index finger, wrist, and the distal right upper extremity. One open nodule has a small crust on the top. There are no other
 cutaneous lesions and no adenopathy.
 A sample is obtained for biopsy and culture. The biopsy shows mixed pyogenic and granulomatous inflammation. Gram stain, acid-fast/partial
 acid-fast, silver methenamine, and periodic acid-Schiff stains (PAD) are negative. Cultures are pending.

 the patient still has been waking up 3-4 times per week in the middle of the night with substernal chest pain, which usually resolves spontaneously
 in 7-8 minutes but sometimes requires nitroglycerin. His other medical problems include diffcult-to-control hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and
 peripheral vascular disease. The patient has smoked cigarettes for 35 years and quit 5 years ago. His medications include aspirin, metoprolol,
 isosorbide mononitrate, amlodipine, lisinopril, rosuvastatin, and nitroglycerin as neede. He takes all his medications during the morning hours.

 echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%. During exercise single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)
 perforrned a month ago, the patient exercised for 8 minutes and reached 85% of age-pred cted maximal pred cted heart rate. He stopped due to
 fatigue and mild chest discomfort. Stress SPECT images showed a moderately extensive inferior wall reversible defect.

She immigrated with her family to the United States from Thailand 15 years ago. She is a nurse's aide and had a recent work physical performed prior to starting a new job. The physician noted ""irregular heart sounds"" and performed an EKG, which showed atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 85 beats per minute.
 A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular size and function with an ejection fraction of 60%. The left atrium was severely dilated and the mitral valve leaflets were thickened with restricted motion and mild focal calcification. The mitral valve area was calculated at 1.0 cm2 (normal 4-6 cm2) with a moderate degree of mitral regurgitation. The aortic valve was trileaflet without stenosis or regurgitation. There was moderate tricuspid regurgitation with an estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 72mm Hg , consistent with severe pulmonary hypertension (normal <30 mm Hg).
